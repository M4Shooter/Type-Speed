#Python Type-Speed Tester

This is a small application that I made, well, for fun. It contains about 1800 different words extracted from a Sherlock Holmes' novel
(Using <a href="http://www.areeb-beigh.tk/my_works/python/index.html" target="_blank">using my word extractor</a>). It will choose a random word from the entire list and you'll have to type that in. Repeat the same for 120 seconds (2 minutes) & at the end you'll receive a statistics of your typing speed.

##Possible Snags

###1. Spellings
Since there are over 1800 words in the program I can't make sure all of them are correct since I'm not sure about the spellings of the words from the source so if you find any typos in the words please let me know.

###2. Bugs
If you find any bugs in the program, again feel free to let me know about the bug. Make sure to add a brief description.
